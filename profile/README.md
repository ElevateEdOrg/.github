# AI-Powered EdTech Platform

## Overview
ElevateEd is an AI-driven EdTech platform designed with a **microservices architecture** to ensure scalability and modularity. The platform enables students to **enroll in courses, take AI-generated assessments, and receive personalized learning recommendations**. Instructors can create and manage courses, while real-time communication fosters interactive learning. The platform is available as a **web and mobile application**.

## Repository Structure
The project is divided into multiple repositories, each handling a specific functionality within the microservices architecture:

| Repository | Tech Stack | Functionality |

| [elevateed-backend-chat](https://github.com/ElevateEdOrg/elevateed-backend-chat) | Node.js, Express | Chat module for student-instructor communication |
| [elevateed-backend-course](https://github.com/ElevateEdOrg/elevateed-backend-course) | Node.js, Express | Course management (creation, enrollment, updates) |
| [elevated-api-gateway](https://github.com/ElevateEdOrg/elevated-api-gateway) | Node.js, Express | API Gateway for routing, authentication, and load balancing |
| [elevated-frontend-web](https://github.com/ElevateEdOrg/elevated-frontend-web) | Vite, React | Web frontend for students & instructors |
| [elevated-frontend-app](https://github.com/ElevateEdOrg/elevated-frontend-app) | React Native | Mobile application for course access & assessments |
